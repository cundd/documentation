PHP debugging
=============

We use `Xdebug <https://xdebug.org/>`__ for debugging purposes. For
details, please refer to the `Xdebug
documentation <https://xdebug.org/docs/>`__.

Environments
------------

Xdebug is installed and enabled in all ``DEV``
`environments <../services/website.md#DEV>`__.

Debugging
---------

Remote debugging is enabled by default in all ``DEV``
`environments <../services/website.md#DEV>`__. To allow multiple debug
sessions in multiple installations at the same time, a random port is
assigned to each website at ``xdebug.remote_port``. If your debug
destination (e.g. PhpStorm) is on another machine, you have to reverse
forward this debug port to your desired destination, e.g.
``ssh -R 13377:localhost:13377 <username>@<hostname>``.

Profiler
--------

Profiling is disabled by default, enable it by setting
``xdebug.profiler_enable = On`` or you can trigger the generation of
profiler files by using the ``XDEBUG_PROFILE`` GET/POST parameter, or
set a cookie with the name ``XDEBUG_PROFILE``. By default, profiler
output well be written into the ``~/tmp/`` directory.

Warning: Enable profiling can generate a lot of data. Make sure your
diskspace is sufficient to store this files and disable profiling as
soon as possible
