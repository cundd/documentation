Access
======

The following ways are provided to access your server and files.

SSH
---

Warning: due to security reasons, we allow key based logins only

Your server is accessible trough SSH by default. We allow only key based
logins as non privileged user (no root Login).

Generic ``devop`` user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On all servers, a user named ``devop`` is created by default. This user
is required to execute the ``puppet-agent`` shortcut as long as there
are no other services/users configured. Furthermore, this user belongs
to the ``adm`` group which enable access to all system log files in
``/var/log/``.

Shortcuts and sudo configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the installed services, the following shortcuts might be
available to execute certain commands with root privileges:

-  ``puppet-agent``: trigger puppet agent run
-  ``nginx-reload``: reload nginx webserver
-  ``nginx-restart``: restart nginx webserver
-  ``fpm-reload``: reload PHP-FPM daemon
-  ``fpm-restart``: restart PHP-FPM daemon
-  ``uwsgi-reload``: reload uwsgi daemon
-  ``uwsgi-restart``: restart uwsgi daemon
-  ``varnish-reload``: reload Varnish daemon
-  ``varnish-restart``: restart Varnish daemon
-  ``nodejs-restart``: restart current nodejs daemon
-  ``nodejs-start``: start current nodejs daemon
-  ``nodejs-stop``: stop current nodejs daemon
-  ``tomcat8-reload``: reload Tomcat daemon
-  ``tomcat8-restart``: restart Tomcat daemon
-  ``docker-restart``: restart Docker daemon
-  ``elastic-start``: start elasticsearch daemon
-  ``elastic-stop``: stop elasticsearch daemon
-  ``elastic-restart``: restart elasticsearch daemon
-  ``elastic-force-reload``: force-reload elasticsearch daemon


.. _ssh-key-handling:

Key Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add global keys to your server like this:

::

    ssh::keys:
      "enduser":
        "contact@example.net":
          "key": "ssh-rsa AAAAB....."

Please use a valid contact address, so we are able to get in touch if
something comes up.

Additionaly, you can add custom environment variables to those keys.
They get applied on every SSH login:

::

    ssh::keys:
      "enduser":
        "contact@example.net":
          "environment":
            "EDITOR":              "/usr/bin/vi"
            "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME":     "Bob"
            "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL":    "bob@example.net"
            "GIT_COMMITTER_NAME":  "Bob"
            "GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL": "bob@example.net"
          "key": "ssh-rsa AAAAB....."

Create SSH Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  use 4096 bit RSA Keys
-  encrypt with PKCS8

::

    ssh-keygen -b 4096 -C user@domain.ch -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tmp
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tmp -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tmp.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tmp 

SSH client configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add client configurations to ``/etc/ssh/ssh_config`` by setting the
``ssh::config`` hash:

::

    ssh::config:
      "Host":     "git"
      "HostName": "code.example.com"
      "User":     "git"

.. Hint:: use ``man ssh_config`` (`online version <http://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config>`_) for available configuration options

SFTP
~~~~

After adding your publickey to the server, is it possible to connect
over SFTP. We recommend to use one of the following clients:

-  `Filezilla <https://filezilla-project.org>`__
-  `Cyperduck <https://cyberduck.io>`__

.. Hint:: To store your key in the memory and not having to enter the password for every connection - use pageant (Windows) or ssh-add it (Linux)

FTP
---

There is no FTP daemon installed by default. Please consider to use
SSH/SCP when possible. If you really need access by FTP, follow the
instructions on :doc:`../services/ftp`.
