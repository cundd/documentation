By now, there are still some manual steps required to install a new server.
Therefore, you have to order them manually through our team.
We are working hard to finish our API where those manual steps are not required anymore.

In the meantime, we will receive orders for new servers by E-Mail. Please submit the following informations:

* billing contact
* technical contact, if applicable
* desired hostname (customer01.snowflakehosting.ch)
* size (CPU, Memory, Diskspace)
